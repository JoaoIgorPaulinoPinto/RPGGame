# SPACE BEGGAR

This project was a final course project, created primarily for personal improvement, to demonstrate my skills and abilities, and also to challenge myself to develop a game from start to finish. Personally, I consider this outcome a success.

## Story
1. A space patroller loses control of their ship and crashes on a strange planet. Upon impact, they lose consciousness. When they regain their senses, they realize that parts of their ship are missing. While exploring, they find a house in the forest and temporarily take shelter there. During their explorations, they find a vendor selling exactly the parts they need, but at very high prices. The protagonist realizes they will need to make money by any means necessary to recover their parts and continue their mission.
